      We develop ML methods that effectively represent individual user preferences in a scalable and generalizable way. Our research leverages user-centric signals, including behavioral patterns, contextual information, and temporal dynamics, to build adaptive models that personalize experiences across diverse tasks. We integrate graph-based architectures, sequential modeling, and multimodal representations to capture the complex and evolving nature of userâ€“item relationships. To address concept drift and changing user interests, we explore continual learning strategies that enable models to adapt over time. These approaches form the foundation for robust personalized systems, supporting applications such as recommendation, search, and user-aligned AI agents.

      Graphs represent attributes of entities and their relationships in complex systems such as social networks, hyperlink networks, knowledge graphs, user-item networks, molecular graphs, and biomedical networks as well as modeling 3D objects in a point cloud, connections of computer systems, and function calls in source code. Graph ML is an emerging research area, which aims at learning deep representation on graphs for a wide range of applications from recommender systems and natural language processing to drug discovery and fraud detection.  In this project, we work on designing machine learning methods for real-world graphs modeling complex, dynamic, and richly-labeled relational structures.

        This research develops lightweight and scalable data mining methods for extracting patterns and knowledge from large, complex datasets under limited computational resources. We focus on compact models, approximate computing, and graph-based representations to ensure efficiency across diverse tasks. Target applications include on-device AI, scalable recommendation, graph search, stream-based event detection, and anomaly detection. By balancing accuracy and efficiency, our work enables adaptive, real-time intelligence in resource-constrained and large-scale environments. Ultimately, we aim to make intelligent systems more accessible, deployable, and responsive across real-world settings.
